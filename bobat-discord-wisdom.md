### hirs and gekitsu on Slopers

```
Manual Focus: any tips for a tall skinny guy just getting into v5-6 slopers?
    I'm having trouble maintaining my friction on the hold and just slip off
    is there training i should start doing now?
(...)
hirs: Slopers are weird. Go from bomber to absolute shite with slight tweaks in
    body position, wrist position, where you're holding it etc.
    Less about keeping weight under it, more about keeping forearm/wrist locked
    in the right position imo. "Weight under" is a good cue to keep forearm and
    wrist position good, but kinda makes no sense when you need to pull on the
    sloper.
Manual Focus: would training my antagonist muscles in that area help?
gekitsu: that’s worded really well, hirs!
hirs: Open hand strength and just experimenting and learning from experience is
    probably best way to improve on slopers
Manual Focus: so what youre saying is slopers are about to make me plateau
hirs: Nah man, i used to hate them. But it'll just click if you smash out a lot
    of sloper stuff
gekitsu: like, when you have to pull over the sloper, maintaining a hand and
    arm angle that doesn’t change the vector of the force you’re applying to
    the hold, despite your centre of gravity moving closer to the hold or even
    above it.
hirs: ^^
(...)
hirs: When you're hanging a sloper and then need to move off it, really focus
    on only moving from the elbow and shoulder. Don't let your wrist move at
    all
Manual Focus: lock it in and leave it
hirs: Yup
    Then after that it is just finding the sweet spot and correct initial body
    position to make them work
Manual Focus: i can usually feel out the spot
    but just slip off
    probably cause im still using my wrist to pivot around
hirs: Yeah, that is quite likely
    Really drop that elbow and keep wrist locked as you move and should notice
    a big difference

### The Whole Gang Weighing In on How to Improve Footwork

```
Sean: I'm quite intrigued how others improve their footwork and movement in
    bouldering and leading. Any one from here have anything they do in
    particular
MrFisto: Climbing slow and watching every foot placement is my go to. Bonus of
    not adjusting the foot once it's placed.
Sean: Yeah I'll definitely try that
    Mostly when I try a bit harder all seems to go to shit really
MrFisto: Focusing on toeing in really hard on holds is good as well, as all
    that tension transmits to your whole body.
epthianura: Glass holds
    Imagine they're made of glass
    Put your toe on carefully. Weight it deliberately once it's on the right
    place.
Oats: What the others said, though. I think it's good to just be conscious of
    the footwork; go slow and watch your feet. Don't look away until it's
    placed/weighed upon. I find a really good opportunity to do it is when you
    are warming up because (hopefully) over time you build that habit in. So
    even when you are climbing harder stuff, it's something that becomes more
    intuitive to do
    I also think it's not enough to just place it quietly or whatever else.
    I see a lot of people place their foot well (great!) but they still don't
    actually weigh or sit on it
    Something you can do to try to make sure you've actually weighed the foot
    is drop your butt out, flex the ankles on that hold, etc. (again, I often
    do this on warmups)
    Something I also do (easier on vert and slab) is see how much you can
    actually weight your foot on a hold and see if you can reduce the number
    of fingers/palm you have on a hold so you're barely hanging on w/ your
    fingers/arms. All the weight should be in your feet. If you're doing
    overhanging stuff, sometimes I'll plant my feet somewhere, and just move
    my arms up. Try not to cut. It will feel like shit for sure when you are
    stretched out, but it's a good way to think about body tension and plant
    those feet!
    But yeah, mostly just be conscious of it all the time, and build up those
    good habits
    /endwalloftext
    (One more thing – avoid hop matches if you can. I always consciously make
    sure I touch the corner of a hold so I make room for the other foot if I
    need to match, or I just smush the foot on top, or even smear the wall).
    The hop match isn't bad per se and sometimes you really have no option
    when it's a tiny ass piece of shit....but I see people hop matching on
    giant jugs and stuff like that all the time and it's like...nah you don't
    need to do that)
Slie: trust them feet!
    i was showing someone a move a couple days ago on a climb they were stuck
    on. death gripping like crazy, using almost all upper body to support
    themselves.
    did the move using one foot only, took both hands and my other foot off
    the wall.
    she was like "i really need to start trusting my feet"
    you know what I've found goes hand in hand with foot work, is hip/pelvis
    work.
    I find a lot of people struggle to weight their feet because they don't get
    their hips in close to the wall

### Adam Ondra Heel Hook Cliff Notes

(These are excerpted from a [Sneak Peek](https://altitudeclimbing.com/adam-ondra-sneak-peek/) for Adam’s lead climbing video course at Altitude)

* Heel hook placement
	* Contact area: the very outside of your heel. Think the triangle area where many shoes have a bit of the upper material peek through between the sole and the slingshot around the achilles tendon.
	* Placement: place the heel with the foot vertical, contacting the hold with the rear of your heel, then make the foot do a ‘windshield wiper’ outwards until it rests with the side of the heel on the hold.
	* Use this ‘windshield-wipe’ as a cue to engage as many muscles as possible as early in the placement as possible: knee flexed to pull your hip closer, hip rotation to pull down into the hold.
	* The further you can ‘windshield-wipe,’ the more you can engage the rear *and outside* of your thigh and hip/glute. Extreme angles (toes pointing below horizontal if your flexibility permits) also put your knee at a higher stress position, so be judicious!
* Using the heel hook
	* To reach up, rotate your entire leg from the hip so you roll your foot ‘into’ the wall, knee above the foot, and hip rotation pulling inwards.
	* You gain more height, engage more muscles, and generate force away from the wall to make your heel feel like a ‘third hand.’
	* On the outmost point of your ‘windshield-wipe,’ you may even find some friction against the wall or make use of a little ripple on the rock to get a heel–toe cam going. (More an outdoors thing.)
	* Adam says this technique is the best choice in 90–95% of cases.
* The ‘wrong way’ (how Adam sees many climbers lose potential on their heel hooks):
	* Contact area: not the outside heel but the sole rubber going up at the rear of the heel, below where the achilles tendon meets it.
	* Allows for relatively solid ‘hanging’ but encourages being more passive and missing out on engaging big parts of the posterior chain in your legs and hips. In this position, you pull almost exclusively from the hamstrings.
	* However, this can be the right choice when hooking around an arete out to the side.
* Heel–hand matching:
	* Often, you will place your heel to match the hand you’re going to move.
	* Usually, it’s the better choice is to commit to the pretzel and place the heel *inside* your hand.
	* This allows you to see the placement.
	* Hand outside the heel encourages keeping compression between the hands while you’re moving up.
	* Heel closer to the centre of gravity makes for a stronger position to lift your mass and keep it pulled into the wall.
* Troubleshooting your placement:
	* During the ‘windshield-wipe,’ keep your sole facing the wall straight on. That means foot pointed, not toes pulled up.
	* At the end of the ‘windshield-wipe,’ take care not to have rolled your inside edge closer to the wall than the outside edge – keep the sole facing the wall until you start pulling up and over.
	* It’s hard to engage on the heel hook early, when you’re below. Pay extra care to put as much weight through it from the beginning.
	* Make sure you’re using your knee to pull the hips close – if your knee is too open, it’s likely your hips are far from the heel and it’s harder to pull.
	* ‘Every time you are doing heel hooking and you are feeling that the bottom is engaged, then it means you are heel hooking right’ —Adam Ondra

Describing this movement in text is not easy, but if you keep an eye out for how Adam heel hooks, you should hopefully be able to make sense of it. ;)

#### Bumps on the Big Toe Knuckle

Not necessarily something that requires treatment, unless they cause pain and make you unable to climb.

* `u/nibblesonthebias` – [Bump on big toe: 1-year update and related thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/7uppa2/bump_on_big_toe_1year_update_and_related_thoughts/) – A (now deleted, thanks `u/climbing` moderators, you unshelled fucking walnuts) reddit thread mentioning silicone toe sleeves to alleviate the big toe bump. Worked for several of us. You’ll probably find these sleeves on amazon or similar stores. They are a stretchy knit/fabric on the outside and have a layer of silicon on the inside to provide a little cushioning. They usually are way longer than a toe and you’re meant to cut them to length.

#### RICE vs. MEAT

RICE (rest, ice, compress, elevate) has been a common recommendation for soft tissue injuries for decades.
But MEAT (movement, exercise, analgesia, treatment) is the more productive approach.
Even Dr. Gabe Mirkin, who coined the RICE mnemonic in the 70s, switched his stance on this.
(Thanks to Anne for compiling the links and being a frequent advocate for letting inflammation do its thing in multiple rehab discussions.)

#### The Abrahangs Discussion

Emil Abrahamsson published a [video on his channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE) featuring a low-intensity hangboard programme that yielded good recovery for his brother Felix and some interesting results for Emil.
Internet notoriety ensued.

* Bouldering Bobat Crew and Tom Randall – BB Q&A with Tom Randall: A twitch.tv livestream (VOD offline since) where Tom Randall answers community questions, including a short bit on the Abrahamssons’ program. Tom’s TL;DR: Please do not use this as a cure-all, super effective secret sauce for massive gains. It has its uses for rehabilitation and for people new to hangboarding, and the science it is based on is solid as well. But for most performance-increasing uses, there are more targeted exercise regimens. Read the science and see if what this does applies to your situation.
* The Nugget Climbing Podcast – [Ep. 119, Carrie Cooper](https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/carrie-cooper) has a segment on a tissue health protocol Dr. Cooper recommends that is very similar to Emil’s No-hangs programme, also based on Keith Barr’s research. She calls it ‘Minimums’ and it begins at the 1:58:00 mark.
