### hirs and gekitsu on Slopers

```
Manual Focus: any tips for a tall skinny guy just getting into v5-6 slopers?
    I'm having trouble maintaining my friction on the hold and just slip off
    is there training i should start doing now?
(...)
hirs: Slopers are weird. Go from bomber to absolute shite with slight tweaks in
    body position, wrist position, where you're holding it etc.
    Less about keeping weight under it, more about keeping forearm/wrist locked
    in the right position imo. "Weight under" is a good cue to keep forearm and
    wrist position good, but kinda makes no sense when you need to pull on the
    sloper.
Manual Focus: would training my antagonist muscles in that area help?
gekitsu: that’s worded really well, hirs!
hirs: Open hand strength and just experimenting and learning from experience is
    probably best way to improve on slopers
Manual Focus: so what youre saying is slopers are about to make me plateau
hirs: Nah man, i used to hate them. But it'll just click if you smash out a lot
    of sloper stuff
gekitsu: like, when you have to pull over the sloper, maintaining a hand and
    arm angle that doesn’t change the vector of the force you’re applying to
    the hold, despite your centre of gravity moving closer to the hold or even
    above it.
hirs: ^^
(...)
hirs: When you're hanging a sloper and then need to move off it, really focus
    on only moving from the elbow and shoulder. Don't let your wrist move at
    all
Manual Focus: lock it in and leave it
hirs: Yup
    Then after that it is just finding the sweet spot and correct initial body
    position to make them work
Manual Focus: i can usually feel out the spot
    but just slip off
    probably cause im still using my wrist to pivot around
hirs: Yeah, that is quite likely
    Really drop that elbow and keep wrist locked as you move and should notice
    a big difference

### The Whole Gang Weighing In on How to Improve Footwork

```
Sean: I'm quite intrigued how others improve their footwork and movement in
    bouldering and leading. Any one from here have anything they do in
    particular
MrFisto: Climbing slow and watching every foot placement is my go to. Bonus of
    not adjusting the foot once it's placed.
Sean: Yeah I'll definitely try that
    Mostly when I try a bit harder all seems to go to shit really
MrFisto: Focusing on toeing in really hard on holds is good as well, as all
    that tension transmits to your whole body.
epthianura: Glass holds
    Imagine they're made of glass
    Put your toe on carefully. Weight it deliberately once it's on the right
    place.
Oats: What the others said, though. I think it's good to just be conscious of
    the footwork; go slow and watch your feet. Don't look away until it's
    placed/weighed upon. I find a really good opportunity to do it is when you
    are warming up because (hopefully) over time you build that habit in. So
    even when you are climbing harder stuff, it's something that becomes more
    intuitive to do
    I also think it's not enough to just place it quietly or whatever else.
    I see a lot of people place their foot well (great!) but they still don't
    actually weigh or sit on it
    Something you can do to try to make sure you've actually weighed the foot
    is drop your butt out, flex the ankles on that hold, etc. (again, I often
    do this on warmups)
    Something I also do (easier on vert and slab) is see how much you can
    actually weight your foot on a hold and see if you can reduce the number
    of fingers/palm you have on a hold so you're barely hanging on w/ your
    fingers/arms. All the weight should be in your feet. If you're doing
    overhanging stuff, sometimes I'll plant my feet somewhere, and just move
    my arms up. Try not to cut. It will feel like shit for sure when you are
    stretched out, but it's a good way to think about body tension and plant
    those feet!
    But yeah, mostly just be conscious of it all the time, and build up those
    good habits
    /endwalloftext
    (One more thing – avoid hop matches if you can. I always consciously make
    sure I touch the corner of a hold so I make room for the other foot if I
    need to match, or I just smush the foot on top, or even smear the wall).
    The hop match isn't bad per se and sometimes you really have no option
    when it's a tiny ass piece of shit....but I see people hop matching on
    giant jugs and stuff like that all the time and it's like...nah you don't
    need to do that)
Slie: trust them feet!
    i was showing someone a move a couple days ago on a climb they were stuck
    on. death gripping like crazy, using almost all upper body to support
    themselves.
    did the move using one foot only, took both hands and my other foot off
    the wall.
    she was like "i really need to start trusting my feet"
    you know what I've found goes hand in hand with foot work, is hip/pelvis
    work.
    I find a lot of people struggle to weight their feet because they don't get
    their hips in close to the wall
