### hirs and gekitsu on Slopers

```
Manual Focus: any tips for a tall skinny guy just getting into v5-6 slopers?
	I'm having trouble maintaining my friction on the hold and just slip off
	is there training i should start doing now?
(...)
hirs: Slopers are weird. Go from bomber to absolute shite with slight tweaks in
	body position, wrist position, where you're holding it etc.
	Less about keeping weight under it, more about keeping forearm/wrist locked
	in the right position imo. "Weight under" is a good cue to keep forearm and
	wrist position good, but kinda makes no sense when you need to pull on the
	sloper.
Manual Focus: would training my antagonist muscles in that area help?
gekitsu: that’s worded really well, hirs!
hirs: Open hand strength and just experimenting and learning from experience is
	probably best way to improve on slopers
Manual Focus: so what youre saying is slopers are about to make me plateau
hirs: Nah man, i used to hate them. But it'll just click if you smash out a lot
	of sloper stuff
gekitsu: like, when you have to pull over the sloper, maintaining a hand and
	arm angle that doesn’t change the vector of the force you’re applying to
	the hold, despite your centre of gravity moving closer to the hold or even
	above it.
hirs: ^^
