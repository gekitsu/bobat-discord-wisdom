### hirs and gekitsu on Slopers

```
Manual Focus: any tips for a tall skinny guy just getting into v5-6 slopers?
    I'm having trouble maintaining my friction on the hold and just slip off
    is there training i should start doing now?
(...)
hirs: Slopers are weird. Go from bomber to absolute shite with slight tweaks in
    body position, wrist position, where you're holding it etc.
    Less about keeping weight under it, more about keeping forearm/wrist locked
    in the right position imo. "Weight under" is a good cue to keep forearm and
    wrist position good, but kinda makes no sense when you need to pull on the
    sloper.
Manual Focus: would training my antagonist muscles in that area help?
gekitsu: that’s worded really well, hirs!
hirs: Open hand strength and just experimenting and learning from experience is
    probably best way to improve on slopers
Manual Focus: so what youre saying is slopers are about to make me plateau
hirs: Nah man, i used to hate them. But it'll just click if you smash out a lot
    of sloper stuff
gekitsu: like, when you have to pull over the sloper, maintaining a hand and
    arm angle that doesn’t change the vector of the force you’re applying to
    the hold, despite your centre of gravity moving closer to the hold or even
    above it.
hirs: ^^
(...)
hirs: When you're hanging a sloper and then need to move off it, really focus
    on only moving from the elbow and shoulder. Don't let your wrist move at
    all
Manual Focus: lock it in and leave it
hirs: Yup
    Then after that it is just finding the sweet spot and correct initial body
    position to make them work
Manual Focus: i can usually feel out the spot
    but just slip off
    probably cause im still using my wrist to pivot around
hirs: Yeah, that is quite likely
    Really drop that elbow and keep wrist locked as you move and should notice
    a big difference
