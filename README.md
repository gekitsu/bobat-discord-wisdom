If you have an account on here, feel free to pull request. Otherwise, hit me up on the Discord with message links to exchanges or wisdom nuggets you want added.

As a style guideline, let’s use second-level headings for larger subdivisions, a third-level heading per added entry, and entries themselves in fenced code blocks, 79 characters line length, and subsequent lines indented with 4 spaces.
